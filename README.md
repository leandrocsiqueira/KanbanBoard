# Kanban with Draggable Cards

In this project, I've create a Kanban Layout with Draggable Cards using the Angular Component Dev Kit (CDK).

The [Angular CDK](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) provides us with "a set of behavior primitives for building UI components", including a really easy to use Drag and Drop module named @angular/cdk/drag-drop, which can be used to create drag-and-drop interfaces, like a Kanban layout. The cards can be dragged and dropped to be repositioned within their column or transferred between columns.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

I also used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) with some changes. Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces.

To generate low polygon backgrounds, textures and vectors, I used [Trianglify.io](https://trianglify.io/about), which is based on an open-source library called [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
